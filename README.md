## ATTENTION: FireStic is no longer being developed. I am leaving it here for informational purposes.

### **FireStic**

#### A python script that accepts [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com) alerts as json over http and indexes (puts) the data into [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org)...and notifies you too.

#### Full documentation is located at: [Read The Docs](http://firestic.rtfd.org)

>   **DISCLAIMER:** This script is still being developed and may contain numerous
>   bugs, flaws and discrepencies. It may cause various types of damage and will
>   likely make your hair turn grey and fall out. I am not liable for any
>   situations which result from the use of this code. There is no stated or
>   implied warranty. It may chip, rip, rattle or run down the hill...all
>   without warning. Use at your own risk. I am not a professional programmer
>   and only offer this code as documentation of my humble attempt at solving a
>   problem for my own needs.

#### Highlights
